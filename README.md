# Data-induced-randomness
Code to compute the t-statistical moments of a family of quantum states measured with an observable. Also contains the code to compute the Haar-random t-moments of the observables. 

This code was used to generate the figures of https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19281, which can be found in the notebooks.
